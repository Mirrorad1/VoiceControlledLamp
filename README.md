# VoiceControlledLamp
Instead of having to get out of bed to turn on my snake's heat lamp, I am able to issue a voice command to Siri to remotely turn it on via the SiriControl-System Framework & a Raspberrypi 3 Model B+

> Very simple at the moment, I want to see what more I'm able to do with voice commands
